# Sudoku Solver

An attempt at writing a sudoku puzzle solver. I really liked the [sudoku9x9](https://www.sudoku9x9.com/smartsolver.php) solver, but thought the UI could be a little better.

##  Where I'm at with it

#### Done
- Board is rendering okay, with large numbers and small numbers
- Errors in large numbers are highlighted
- Several test scenarios available and can be loaded in
- Can fill in the possibilities

#### TODO
- create a nice way to set numbers
  - Let's try using the possibilities array, with hover and click events


#### Plans

- To provide a step-though solver
  - To provide a choice when there are multiple numbers you can solve

- To make a playable game
  - Enable different assistance levels
